# static-web-site


GitHub Pages is a free service provided by GitHub that lets you **host websites directly from a GitHub repository**. Itâ€™s commonly used for:

- **Personal or portfolio sites**
- **Documentation for projects**
- **Static websites** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

### ðŸ”§ How it works:
1. **You create a repository on GitHub.**
2. **You push your website files** (like `index.html`, `style.css`, etc.) to that repo.
3. You **enable GitHub Pages** in the repository settings.
4. GitHub will then build and serve your site at a URL like:
   ```
   https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/
   ```

You can also use a custom domain if you have one.

### ðŸ”¥ Perks:
- Itâ€™s **free**!
- No need for a separate web host.
- Integrates seamlessly with Jekyll (a static site generator, also supported by GitHub Pages).
- Great for developers showing off projects or writing documentation.

- THE CODE FOR THE WEBSITE IS IN MASTER BRANCH
